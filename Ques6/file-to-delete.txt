Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking model.

It can handle many connections at once without waiting for one to finish before starting another.

This makes it great for real-time apps and high-traffic websites.

Here are some examples of what you can build with Node.js:

Web servers and websites
REST APIs
Real-time apps (like chat)
Command-line tools
Working with files and databases
IoT and hardware control
